<!-- FIXME -->

Electrical Engineer who loves all things Engineering. Talk to me about your favorite: screw, microcontrollers, or fusion reactor. I love it all. Tweet me your favorite random engineering thing!

- **Favorite Screw** : [Robertson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_screw_drives#Robertson)
- **Favorite uC**    : HCS08 (soft spot for my first uC!)
- **Favorite Fusion Reactor**: [Pollywell Reactor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell)

# Post-graduate Courses #
- *Essential Principles of Signal Integrity* by Eric Bogatin at bethesignal.com

## Areas of Expertise ##

- Mixed-signal application-specific systems engineering, including: analog and digital circuit design and signal processing, microcontroller specification and interface design, embedded software and networking design, high-speed PCB design (8GHz) for both digital and analog signals, power supplies, and precision DAC / ADCs.

- Precision instrumentation and component design including: early product definition and performance specification, concept development, prototyping, debugging, concept refinement, design qualification, and release to manufacturing.

- Extensive experience in all phases of ECAD – part library creation, schematic entry, high-density and multi-layer PCB layout, post-layout signal integrity analysis, DFM, pilot production, and board-level test.

- Extensive experience in all phases of ASIC design – custom and standard cell creation, schematic entry, layout, parasitic extraction and circuit simulation, post-wafer processing, and wafer / die level testing.

- Hardware and firmware reverse engineering at both the system and the sub-circuit level.

- Data analysis and algorithm development, implementing a model in a high-level language,
transferring a model into an embedded language, data visualization and explanation.

- Engineering project management: direct procurement of components and materials, managing the manufacturing process.

- Technical management, project management, managing partners and sub-contractors, and mentorship of junior engineers.

- System level design and optimization.

## Technical Skills ##

- **Software**: Altium, Pulsonix, Cadence Virtuoso, C/C++, Python, SPICE, VHDL, and embedded
Linux.

- **Hardware**: Xilinx, AVR, NXP, MSP430, Tektronix, Agilent and Rhode and Schwartz test equipment.

- **Peripherals**: I2C, SPI, CAN, UART, RS-485, RS-232.

- **Prototyping**: Board bring-up, ASIC bring-up, Cabling, SMD assembly and re-work, basic manual machining, 3D printing, and test automation.
